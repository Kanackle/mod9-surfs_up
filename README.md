# Module 9- Surfs Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to see if a surf shop in Oahu was viable to be open the whole year. To figure out that out, temperature data from June and December were obtained. 

## Results
1. The average temperature was higher in June than December, but only slightly. 
2. The standard deviation was roughly the same for both months, meaning the spread of data was also roughly the same.
3. There was a larger difference between the minimum temperatures between the two months than the max temperature. 

## Analysis
Using the data from all June and December months from the given time period, we can see that, in terms of temperature, it is okay to have a surf shop year round. The average temperature between the two month sets only had a difference of 4 degrees, which in terms of temperature is negligible. The difference between the max temperature was only 2 degrees, however the difference between the minimum temperature is about 8 degrees. 

## Additional Query
1. I wish to learn about the precipiation data between the two sets of months. Temperature helps to know how suitable the location is for tourists to come, however precipitation is also needed. If the location is too rainy, then the shop will not get the required amount of business. 
2. The December data set is noticeably smaller than the June data set. Just to have more comparable sizes, the originial data set should extend out to the end of the year, rather than end in August.
